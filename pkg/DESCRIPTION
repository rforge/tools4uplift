Description: Uplift modeling aims at predicting the causal effect of an action such as a medical
    treatment or a marketing campaign on a particular individual, by taking into consideration
    the response to a treatment. In order to simplify the task for practitioners in uplift modeling,
    we propose a combination of tools that can be separated into the following ingredients: 
    i) quantization, ii) visualization, iii) feature engineering, iv) feature selection and, 
    v) model validation. For more details, please read Belbahri et Al. (2019)
